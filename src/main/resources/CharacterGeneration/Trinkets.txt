A ship's flag that doesn't move in the wind.
The fantastical skull of a rare hornless unicorn... or at least that's what the merchant who sold it to you claimed it was. He wouldn't have lied to you now, would he?
An otherwise ordinary skull, if not for the third eyehole nestled in the center of its forehead.
A scrimshaw depicting several northern nomads hunting a great elk, carved into the tooth of a saber-toothed tiger.
A black ring covered with some very faint, illegible etchings that glow with a red light when in darkness. It feels somewhat warm to the touch when worn.
The last baby tooth of a young giant, who lost it long ago.
The skull of a wolf, peculiar for the rack of antlers sprouting from the top of its head.
A small, mechanical bear that fits in the palm of your hand. It dances whenever music is played, yet no power source nor mechanism can be detected.
A small wooden top that refuses to stop spinning, despite your best efforts.
A sealed glass jar filled with a pale, reddish liquid. A small, deformed humanoid floats in the middle of it, and you swear that you can see it twitch whenever you are not looking directly at it.
A note you found in your pocket one day instead of a pouch of coins. It only says "IOU".
An odd torch that produces a blue flame yet seemingly no heat or light. At least it never goes out.
A set of exquisitely crafted dice, carved from the tusks of a mammoth. Dwarvish runes replace the typical pips on the sides, and glow a faint blue.
A vial of purple fluid that, when poured onto an inanimate object of size small or tiny, will cause said object to become translucent in appearance for one hour.
An incredibly crude knife seemingly carved from a stone giant's toenail.
A silver ring with runic etchings. In place of where a jewel would go, however, there is instead a small depression wherein rests an orb of green flame that never goes out but which also does not burn.
A walking stick shaped from a gnarled elm root. A small branch is sprouting from it, tipped with several leaves.
A sealed Ship in a Bottle, enchanted by a wizard. As you watch, the ship rocks back and forth as tiny waves crash about it.
A small bird unlike any you've ever seen, trapped in a chunk of amber.
A tumorous mass of flesh that squelches along the ground behind you, aided by a sinewy mass of veins and arteries that act akin to tentacles.
A pewter armlet adorned with a pack of wolves engraved into its surface. When you rub your fingers lightly over it, the sounds of distant howls echo through the air.
A gold stud earing that whispers completely useless facts into its wearer's ear.
